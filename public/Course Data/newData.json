Known today for his astronomical discoveries and his struggles with the Catholic Church, Galileo also made important contributions to experimental physics, natural philosophy, the interpretation of Holy Scripture, and the philosophy of science. In this class, we will see why Galileo is often called \u201cthe father of modern science.\u201d We will explore Galileo\u2019s scientific contributions and recreate many of Galileo\u2019s original experiments. We will investigate his rejection of the Aristotelian world-view and the far-reaching implications of his mathematization of nature.","Capacity":15,"CurrentEnrollment":13,"MaxEnrollment":999,"LeadInstructorLastName":"Wright","CollegiateCodes":[""],"FastSearchId":26637,"IsChild":false,"ParentCourseCode":"LBST 150  B2","Begins":null,"Ends":null,"BeginYear":2019,"BeginMonth":8,"BeginDay":27,"EndYear":2019,"EndMonth":12,"EndDay":18,"CourseNumber":"150","Period":"A5","Prerequisites":null,"Recommendation":null,"Closed":false,"Instructors":[{"CourseId":"26637","IsLead":true,"FirstName":"Ann","LastName":"Wright"},{"CourseId":"26637","IsLead":false,"FirstName":"Fred","LastName":"Ablondi"}],"Schedule":[{"DayPattern":"MWF","Starts":null,"Ends":null,"StartHour":12,"StartMinute":10,"EndHour":13,"EndMinute":0,"Building":"MCREY","Room":"115"}]},{"CourseId":26638,"Division":"UG","SubjectCode":"LBST","CourseCode":"LBST 150  C1","SectionCode":"C1","YearCode":2019,"TermCode":"1S","Title":"TEC: Humans , Data  & Other  Problems ","Description":"It\u2019s never been easier to access data about the world around us\u2014and yet we must worry more and more about how misleading statistics and fake news can do us harm.
